# recognize-HCM-LVH
This project aims to recognize Left Ventricular Hypertrophy, a form of Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, based on a patient's ECG measurements.
It is a simple method categorization that could give us information whether the patient is showing abnormal pulses and whether they are 
evidence of HCM, using time-differentiated images of the ECG  signal.

SUMMARY: 
This project refers to the analysis of signals of the electrocardiogram with the ultimate goal of creating a code, which will identify the deviations 
of the pulses of the ECG signals based on the duration, the magnitude etc. and comparing them with normal signals. The code and graphical 
representations (GUI) are made in the programming environment of Matlab, using functions from Physionet and MathWorks, and 
the "Pan & Tompkins" algorithm, which was developed to identify the QRS clusters, to further separate the signal into pulses.

RESULTS:
This research has demonstrated that clinical ECG data can be classified correctly as cardiomyopathy or non-cardiomyopathy using a neuro-fuzzy
network training with biogeography-based optimization (BBO). The results have shown a correct classification rate on test data of more than 60%. 
Better results can undoubtedly be achieved with further training, but the main goal of this initial research was to demonstrate the feasibility and 
establish a framework for further improvement.
